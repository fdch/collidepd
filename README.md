### THINGS TO CONSIDER

It will sound better on headphones.

**Some things might be LOUD.**

**Do not** bring the volume slider all the way up.

You will have *more fun on a smartphone*, than on a computer with a mouse.

There is a *small delay* between what you play and what you listen.

If live-streamed, there will be a 20 second delay between what you listen on your device and on the live stream.
